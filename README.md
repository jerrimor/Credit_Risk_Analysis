# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview
For this project, different techniques were used to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. The project required the use of imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.  The overall question is to determine a person's credit risk based off of some input or features. 
Deliverable 1 requirements: use the oversampling RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms and then use the undersampling ClusterCentroids algorithm
