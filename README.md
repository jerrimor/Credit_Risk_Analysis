# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview
For this project, different techniques were used to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. The project required the use of imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.  The overall question is to determine a person's credit risk based off of some input or features that were received from the LendingClub.  A large dataset was retrieved and loaded to evaulate and attempt to predict credit risk.   

Deliverable 1 requirements: use the oversampling RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms and then use the undersampling ClusterCentroids algorithm, Using these algorithms, resample the dataset, view the count of the target classes, train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report

## Results
There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models
Six machine learning models were created and used as part of this analysis.  Before the models were run, the data was cleaned by removing irrelevant columns and by converting strings to numerical values. The results of each model is below with details included.
